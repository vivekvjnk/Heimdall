## Prompt
<ValidationWrapper Code>
===

above code is a llm wrapper to ensure structured output. I want to publish it as a opensource langgraph module. Here is the plan.

1. First identify all the dependencies of the module. Make module independent of any internal dependencies, hence making it truly modular

2. Then we will remove the class wrapping and make it a simple langgraph graph of node and orchestration functions.

3. Now we're in good position to ensure alignment with langgraph requirements for subgraphs. We will verify the requirement compatibility.

4. Release module as an independent pip package with a git repo.

5. Request langgraph to integrate it 
===

## GEMINI
Of course. This is an excellent plan for turning your `ValidationWrapper` into a reusable, open-source LangGraph module. It's a much-needed utility, as structured output validation is a common challenge.

Let's walk through your 5-step plan with concrete actions and code refactoring for each stage.

-----

### ✅ Step 1: Identify & Remove Internal Dependencies

First, we need to isolate the code from your specific project's environment. A reusable module cannot have hardcoded paths or rely on internal helper functions.

**Identified Dependencies:**

1.  `get_settings()`: This function is specific to your project. The settings it provides should be passed as arguments.
2.  `OmegaConf.load("configs/general_config/base.yaml")`: This is a hardcoded file path and uses a specific configuration library. The module should be agnostic to how configuration is managed.
3.  `get_llm_from_config(...)`: This is another internal factory function. The module should simply accept a pre-configured LangChain `Runnable` (your LLM instance) as an argument.
4.  `configure_rotating_file_handler` and `get_pipeline_logger`: Your logging setup is custom. A library should use the standard `logging` module and allow the *user* of the library to configure it.
5.  `callbacks`: This is used as a global variable. It should be passed in via the `config` dictionary during invocation, which is the standard LangGraph practice.
6.  `extract_response_text(...)`: This helper function is required. We'll move it inside our new module file as a private utility function.

**The Goal:** Convert dependencies into parameters. Instead of the module loading its own configuration, the user will pass the necessary objects (like the LLM and parser) when creating the graph.

-----

### ✅ Step 2: Refactor from a Class to a Standalone Graph

A LangGraph subgraph is fundamentally a compiled `Runnable`. The class structure is a good way to organize logic, but for a shareable module, a factory function that *builds and returns* the compiled graph is more idiomatic and flexible.

This factory function will take all the dependencies we identified in Step 1 as arguments. The node functions (`module_call`, `llm_error_check`, etc.) will be defined inside this factory, giving them access to the arguments via closure.

Here is the refactored code. This would be in a new file, for example, `structured_output_validator.py`.

````python

### ✅ Step 3: Ensure Alignment with LangGraph Subgraph Requirements

LangGraph subgraphs (often managed with `graph.add_node(..., my_subgraph)`) have a few key requirements that our refactored design already meets:

1.  **It's a `Runnable`**: The `create_structured_output_validator` function returns a compiled graph, which is a `Runnable` object.
2.  **State Compatibility**: The subgraph's state (`ValidationNodeState`) is self-contained. When you integrate this into a larger graph, the parent graph's state must be a superset of this state. For example, a parent graph could have a state like `class OverallState(ValidationNodeState): user_id: str`, and it would work seamlessly.
3.  **No Side Effects**: The graph is stateless and doesn't rely on global variables. All necessary components are passed in during creation.

Here’s how you would use it in a larger graph:

```python
# Assuming the code from Step 2 is in `structured_output_validator.py`
from structured_output_validator import create_structured_output_validator, ValidationNodeState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 1. Define your Pydantic model and LLMs
class MyData(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="The person's name")
    age: int = Field(description="The person's age")

main_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
correction_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4") # Often good to use a stronger model for corrections

# 2. Create the validation subgraph
validation_graph = create_structured_output_validator(
    module_to_validate=main_llm,
    pydantic_model=MyData,
    correction_llm=correction_llm,
    max_retries=3
)

# 3. Invoke it directly
initial_state = ValidationNodeState(
    messages=[("human", "My name is Bob and I am 30 years old. Format this.")],
    llm_output="",
    error_description="",
    iterations=0
)

final_state = validation_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state['llm_output'])
# Expected Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}
```

-----

### ✅ Step 4: Package as an Independent Pip Package

Now that the code is modular, you can package it for distribution via PyPI.

**Directory Structure:**

```
/langgraph-structured-validator/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src/
    └── langgraph_validator/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── structured_output_validator.py
```

**`pyproject.toml`:** This file defines your project's metadata and dependencies.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "langgraph-structured-validator"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = [
  { name="Your Name", email="your.email@example.com" },
]
description = "A LangGraph utility for validating and correcting structured outputs against a Pydantic model."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
dependencies = [
    "langgraph>=0.0.30",
    "langchain-core>=0.1.40",
    "pydantic>=1.10,<3",
    "pyyaml>=6.0"
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-structured-validator"
Issues = "https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-structured-validator/issues"
```

**`src/langgraph_validator/__init__.py`:** Make your factory function easily importable.

```python
from .structured_output_validator import create_structured_output_validator, ValidationNodeState
```

**To Publish:**

1.  Install packaging tools: `pip install build twine`
2.  Build the package: `python -m build`
3.  Upload to PyPI: `twine upload dist/*`

-----

### ✅ Step 5: Request LangGraph Integration

This is the final and most exciting step\!

1.  **Start with an Issue:** Go to the [LangChain GitHub repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and open a new issue. Propose your contribution. Explain what the module does and why it's useful. Link to your new repository.
2.  **Follow Contribution Guidelines:** The LangChain project has specific guidelines for contributors regarding code style, testing, and documentation. You'll likely need to add unit tests for your module.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request:** After getting feedback on the issue, you can fork the LangChain repo, add your module (most likely to the `libs/community/langchain_community/graphs/` directory), and submit a Pull Request.

By following these steps, you'll have a robust, reusable, and shareable module that can benefit the entire LangGraph community. Good luck\!
